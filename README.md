## 🧩 Overview  

**GoodTask for macOS** is an advanced productivity app that transforms Apple’s built-in **Reminders** and **Calendar** into a fully customizable task management powerhouse. It’s a perfect balance between simplicity and depth — giving users the ability to stay on top of daily routines, complex projects, and everything in between.  

Unlike basic to-do apps, **GoodTask** offers smart automation and flexible organization through **smart lists**, **tags**, and **filters** that adapt to your workflow. You can easily group tasks by context, project, or priority, and view them in elegant, minimal layouts optimized for clarity and speed.  

The app is deeply integrated with macOS, offering **menu bar access**, **widgets**, **shortcuts**, and **real-time syncing** across devices. You can add new tasks via Siri, natural language input, or a simple keyboard shortcut, making task capture frictionless and intuitive.  

Whether you’re following a **GTD methodology**, managing collaborative schedules, or tracking personal goals, **GoodTask** adapts to your productivity style. It’s lightweight yet powerful — a productivity hub that keeps you organized, focused, and on track.
